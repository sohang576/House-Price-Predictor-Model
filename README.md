## üìÇ Project Structure

```
HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTOR_MODEL.ipynb     # Main Jupyter notebook with end‚Äëto‚Äëend pipeline
data/                                # (Optional) Raw and processed datasets
models/                              # Saved model artifacts (e.g. pickle files)

## üéØ Objective

Predict house sale prices based on various features using supervised regression models. The notebook walks through:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model selection, training, and tuning
* Evaluation using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R¬≤
* Deployment‚Äëready saved model (optional)

---

## üß™ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* Data handling: `pandas`, `numpy`
* Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* Machine Learning: `scikit-learn` (and optionally `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`)
* Serialization: `pickle` or `joblib`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sohang576/House-Price-Predictor-Model.git
   cd House-Price-Predictor-Model
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch notebook:**

   ```
   jupyter notebook HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTOR_MODEL.ipynb
   ```

   Follow cells in sequence to explore data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## üîç Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning

* Load dataset (possibly CSV(s)) into `pandas`.
* Inspect missing values, distributions, and correlations.
* Visualize key relationships using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

### 2. Feature Engineering

* Handle missing data (imputation/dropping).
* Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot, ordinal).
* Scale/normalize numerical features as appropriate.
* Possibly derive new features to improve model performance.

### 3. Model Training

* Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 70/30 or 80/20).
* Compare multiple regression models:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Use cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Evaluate using metrics:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * Root MSE (RMSE)
  * R¬≤ (coefficient of determination)
* Visual charts: actual vs. predicted price scatter plot.

### 5. (Optional) Model Serialization

* Save the best-trained model and preprocessing pipeline (e.g., using `pickle`) for future inference or deployment.

## üõ† Usage Example

If you have a trained model serialized (e.g. `model.pkl`):

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

sample = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': [value],
    'feature2': [value],
    # add all required features
})

predicted_price = model.predict(sample)
print("Predicted Price:", predicted_price[0])
```

## üìå Tips & Next Steps

* Enhance **feature engineering** with advanced techniques or external data.
* Introduce **cross-validation** for more robust model performance.
* Explore **ensemble methods** or **neural networks** for potential gains.
* Deploy via Flask, FastAPI, or Flask to create a simple prediction API.
* Validate model generalization by testing on external datasets.
